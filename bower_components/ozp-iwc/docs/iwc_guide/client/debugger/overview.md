##IWC Debugger
The IWC distributables come with a build in IWC debugger. This is hosted with the IWC bus, so developers can open the
debugger tools to check the state of the bus for which they are developing. The default location is `/debugger/index.html`,
relative to the URL of the bus: `http://localhost:13000/debugger/index.html`.

**If developing using the IWC provided sample bus, pointing your browser to `http://localhost:13000` will reach the
debugger.**
