##Intents API Handler Definition Node Endpoints
The Intents API requests Application Nodes listed from the [ozp:intents](overview.md) endpoint. The IWC does not care
how the data is handled on the backend rather that it meets its requirements for a GET and PUT request.

### This backend node is still being defined and will be a future addition to the IWC Bus's endpoint requirements
These nodes will fill the IWC bus with commonly used Intent definitions to aid the user when prompted to make a 
decision. Currently the IWC does not have a preset list of intent definitions, as they will be community (platform)
defined.
